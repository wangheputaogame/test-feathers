# Media player controls

Media players can have many different types of sub-components for customizing the playback behavior. Buttons might pause or play the media, switch to full screen mode, or mute the volume. Sliders might seek to a different time or change the volume. The [`SoundPlayer`](sound-player.html) and [`VideoPlayer`](video-player.html) components may be customized with a number of these controls. Let's look at which ones are available in Feathers.

## `FullScreenToggleButton`

## `MuteToggleButton`

## `PlayPauseToggleButton`

## `SeekSlider`

## `TimeLabel`

## `VolumeSlider`
