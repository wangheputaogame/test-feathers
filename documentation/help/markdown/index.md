# Feathers

Get started with [Feathers](http://feathersui.com/), the open source library of user interface components for the hardware-accelerated [Starling Framework](http://gamua.com/starling/). A robust skinning system enables your creativity, fluid layouts make it easy to deploy to a variety of screens, and support for both touch and mouse interaction puts your apps on mobile and desktop. With Feathers and Starling, you can build fully-standalone native apps for iOS, Android, Windows, and Mac OS X, and you can even deploy to desktop web browsers with Adobe Flash Player. [See an overview of features.](features.html)

## Installation & Getting Started

-   [Download Starling Framework](http://gamua.com/starling/download/)

-   [Download Feathers](http://feathersui.com/download/)

-   Set up Starling and Feathers in your preferred development environment:

    -   [Flash Builder](flash-builder.html)

    -   [IntelliJ IDEA](intellij-idea.html)

    -   [FlashDevelop](flashdevelop.html)

    -   [Flash Professional](flash-pro.html)

-   Follow the instructions in [Getting Started with Feathers](getting-started.html) to create your first "Hello World" app using Feathers.

## Help & Support

There are a number of places where you can get help with Feathers issues or to ask questions.

-   Bookmark the [Feathers API Reference](../api-reference/) for easy access to all of the classes, properties, methods, and events that Feathers components offer.

-   Study the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](faq/index.html). Feathers makes some default choices that aren't necessarily intuitive because they improve performance significantly. For beginners, the FAQ will answer a number of common questions.

-   Ask for help at [Feathers in the Starling Forum](http://forum.starling-framework.org/forum/feathers). Many of the community's experts (including Josh Tynjala, the main author behind Feathers) visit frequently to answer questions. Be sure to try a couple of searches to see if someone else has had the same issue -- maybe your questions have been answered already! If not, then feel free to start a new thread.

-   Submit [bug reports and feature requests](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers/issues) on Github. If you're not quite sure if you've found a bug or not, or if you simply have a question, then please post in the forums first. We can escalate to a bug report later, if needed.

## Platform UI Guidelines

Please take a look at the official documentation linked below for the platforms that Feathers supports. Become familiar with the guidelines for each platform, and try to tailor your application's experience to the specific platform that your code is running on at any given moment. Cross-platform user interface libraries like Feathers can be convenient and powerful, but do not forget that you are responsible for meeting the expectations of your users on each platform. One size rarely fits all.
