For those looking to tweak the example themes provided with Feathers, the following Photoshop documents may be of use.

[Download Feathers](http://feathersui.com/download/) to get the original PNG and TPS files used to build a theme's texture atlas with [Texture Packer](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (version 3.0). Export new PNG graphics from the PSDs below to expand or modify a theme.

Note: The Generate Sprite Sheet feature in Flash CC has a bug where exported images that use inner drop shadow filters have extra transparent padding around the edges. Skins in MinimalDesktopTheme make heavy use of inner drop shadows, and they must be exported manually and trimmed in Photoshop. A bug report has been filed with Adobe.
