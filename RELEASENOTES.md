* New Transition: Iris. Scales a circular mask to animate between two screens.
* New Transition: Wipe. Resizes a clipRect to animate between two screens.
* AddOnFunctionStyleProvider: added callBeforeOriginalStyleProvider property to allow the add-on function to be called first.
* Alert: added customMessageStyleName property.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: fixed an issue where they didn't accept non-Latin characters and ignored characters when Alt key was pressed.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: uses needsSoftKeyboard and requestSoftKeyboard() to show soft keyboard on Android. Vote on [Adobe Bug #3962712](https://bugbase.adobe.com/index.cfm?event=bug&id=3962712) to add iOS support.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: fixed issue where the selection anchor index wasn't properly updated, making the keyboard selection change on the wrong side.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: fixed issue where setting TextInput's parent visible property to false wouldn't clear focus.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: fixed an issue where pasting something other than text would cause a runtime error.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: fixed an issue where changing the text property in an Event.CHANGE listener could cause the cursorSkin to be positioned incorrectly.
* Button: fixed issue where the label text renderer wasn't given an maxHeight that accounted for the button's height and padding.
* ColorFade: fixed name of createBlackFadeTransition().
* Default Item Renderers: fixed issue where children above or below label text renderer couldn't sometimes affect the label's width.
* DropDownPopUpContentManager: fixed issue where pop-up wasn't repositioned if the source moved to a new location.
* DropDownPopUpContentManager: added primaryDirection property to support trying to display the pop-up above the source first, instead of below.

* DropDownPopUpContentManager: fixed issues caused by multiple Starling instances.
* DropDownPopUpContentManager: added isModal and overlayFactory properties to affect how pop-up is displayed.
* FeathersControl: fixed issue where initialize() could be called during initialization.
* FocusManager: added support for new INativeFocusOwner interface, which allows components to be associated with a specific focusable native display object (like text editors!).
* GroupedList: the itemIndex parameter on scrollToDisplayIndex() is now optional so that you can scroll to a group header.
* Header: fixed issue where useExtraPaddingForOSStatusBar property didn't account for contentScaleFactor.
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout: fixed issue where a scrollToDisplayIndex() on a List wouldn't work.
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout: fixed issue where center/middle alignment wasn't properly ignored if total content size was larger than the container bounds (thanks kavolorn!)
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout: fixed issue with alignment when scrolling is required in perpendicular direction.
* HorizontalLayout: fixed issue where items weren't measured correctly sometimes when using percentage dimensions.
* ImageLoader: now accounts for minimum and maximum dimensions when maintaining aspect ratio.
* ImageLoader: now dispatches separate Event.IO_ERROR and Event.SECURITY_ERROR constants instead of FeathersEventType.ERROR.
* ImageLoader: fixed issue where appending variable to ATF URL would break the check for the file extension.
* ImageLoader: added scaleContent, horizontalAlign, and verticalAlign properties.
* ImageLoader: added scaleMode property that uses values from starling.utils.ScaleMode.

* MultiStarlingStyleNameFunctionTheme: a variation of StyleNameFunctionTheme that supports multiple Starling instances.
* LayoutGroup, Scroller (and subclasses), ScreenNavigator, StackScreenNavigator: setting clipContent to false will clear the clipRect only once so that clipRect may be used externally.
* LayoutGroupListItemRenderer, LayoutGroupGroupedListItemRenderer: fixed issue where changing the data would hurt performance because the item renderer would need to validate more than once.
* List: sometimes keeps around an extra item renderer to avoid garbage collection and improve performance. When the typical item is from the data provider, the number of renderered items would fluctuate when scrolling.
* NumericStepper: fixed issue where selection might be changed in TextInput when using arrow keys to step.
* Panel: fixed issue where autoSizeMode property was ignored.
* PopUpManager: fixed issue where adding a pop-up that already had a parent would cause the Event.REMOVED_FROM_STAGE listener to be called early.
* ProgressBar, Slider: fixed issue where the layout would be broken if the minimum equals the maximum.
* RenderDelegate: a display object that passes rendering to another display object that has its own transformations. Useful for custom transitions.
* Scroller: fixed issue where scrollToPageIndex() would not accept negative page indicies.
* Scroller: fixed issue where the container didn't detect major changes to the maximum scroll position, causing it to scroll far beyond the end of the content.
* Scroller: added SCROLL_BAR_DISPLAY_MODE_FIXED_FLOAT to allow the scroll bar floats above the content, but it won't fade out.
* Scroller: fixed issue where INTERACTION_MODE_TOUCH_AND_SCROLL_BARS didn't work in nested scrollers because scroll bars could overlap and stop touches even when scrolling was not possible.
* Scroller: fixed issue where touching the scroll bar thumb wouldn't stop a throw.
* Scroller: fixed issue where a floating scroll bar would be hidden after hover out instead of waiting for the throw animation to finish.
* Scroller: fixed issue where clipping was no properly updated when using INTERACTION_MODE_MOUSE and the view port was resized small enough that scrolling was no longer needed.
* Scroller: fixed issue where Scroller couldn't properly calculate its dimensions when it has a background skin but no view port content, causing an infinite loop.
* Scroller: fixed issue where floating point errors sometimes caused it to snap to the wrong page.
* Scroller: fixed issue where maximum page indices might be one larger than they should be if a floating point error occurs.
* Scroller: snapScrollPositionToPixels now defaults to true.
* Scroller: switched to a different throwEase that is more natural.
* ScrollBar, SimpleScrollBar, Slider: on initialize, clamps value to minimum and maximum because value may not have been set, and it may be outside the range.
* ScrollContainer: fixed issue where getRawChildIndex() didn't reset the displayListBypassEnabled flag before returning the result.
* ScrollContainer: fixed issue where view port resizing wasn't ignored when using AUTO_SIZE_MODE_STAGE, potentially hurting performance.
* ScrollText: uses cacheAsBitmap to improve scrolling performance. A property has been exposed to disable this, if desired.
* ScreenDensityScaleFactorManager: manages the Starling view port and stage dimensions to automatically generate an appropriate contentScaleFactor value based on the screen DPI.
* ScrollContainer: fixed issue where addChild() stopped working with Starling 1.7.
* Slider: thumb position is now rounded to the nearest pixel.
* Slider: added thumbOffset property to allow the thumb to be repositioned in the direction perpendicular to the track.
* SpinnerList: by default, the scroll bar is hidden.
* StackScreenNavigator: fixed issue where setting rootScreenID before screens were added could throw a runtime error.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue where text color wouldn't change when disabled while StageText didn't have focus.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed an issue where where the text editor would try to change the font size property every frame, but it wasn't rounding to an integer, causing the check to fail.
* StyleNameFunctionTheme: added a createRegistry() function that can be overridden in a subclass to customize the style provider registry.
* TabBar: now supports isEnabled in data provider, similar to ButtonGroup.
* TextArea, TextInput: fixed issue where the backgroundFocusedSkin wasn't displayed when the FocusManager was disabled (thanks tcfraser!)
* TextArea: fixed issue where setting the height of the TextArea larger than the text may result in the TextArea not receiving focus.
* TextBlockTextRenderer, TextFieldTextRenderer: fixed issue where the texture would sometimes restore with the wrong font size and clipping.
* TextBlockTextRenderer, TextFieldTextRenderer: fixed issue where snapshot dimensions were rounded down to the nearest pixel, which could cut off a small part of the text.
* TextBlockTextRenderer, TextFieldTextRenderer: uses Texture.empty() and uploads BitmapData manually instead of Texture.fromBitmapData() to avoid the creation of an onRestore function that will be immediately replaced.
* TextBlockTextRenderer, TextFieldTextRenderer: fixed issue where the texture snapshot could be blurry when scaled up from 0.
* Text Renderers: added updateSnapshotOnScaleChange property to allow the snapshot to always be crisp, even when scaled up or down. Use with caution as it needs to check the scale every frame.
* TextBlockTextRenderer: fixed issue where texture snapshot remained visible when the text renderer's width or height was supposed to be 0.
* TextBlockTextRenderer: fixed issue where the cursorSkin wasn't properly positioned and sized when calling setFocus() manually.
* TextBlockTextEditor: fixed an issue where scrolling wasn't working properly on HiDPI displays.
* TextFieldTextEditor: fixed issue where the font displayed at the wrong scale the first time that the text editor received focus on some mobile devices.
* TextFieldTextEditor: fixed issue where accessing the baseline property might throw a runtime error because textSnapshot was null.
* TextFieldTextEditor: exposed some more TextField property that control rendering.
* TextFieldTextRenderer: added useSnapshotDelayWorkaround property and disabled this workaround by default.
* Text Editors: detects changes in contentScaleFactor (such as when switching between HiDPI and normal screens) and recreates snapshots.
* TextInput: can now receive focus when isEditable is false.
* TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsCount: The requestedColumnCount property may now be used to calculate an ideal width for that number of columns, if the container doesn't have an explicitWidth. (TiledColumnsLayout uses the requestedRowCount property).
* ValidationQueue: skips components in queue that are no longer on the display list.
* ValidationQueue: will not proceed if Starling's context is invalid. This may happen if a TouchEvent.TOUCH listener causes a lost context.
* VerticalSpinnerLayout: fixed issue where item heights weren't forced to the same size, which could cause large gaps or overlapping items.
* YouTubeFeeds: example updated to use newer YouTube API since the old one was shut down.
* Transitions: changed some to use RenderDelegate to avoid removing screens from display list.
* Examples: use Context3DProfile.BASELINE for mobile examples, since it is widely supported on mobile.
* Examples: enabled supportHighResolution flag for mobile apps so that they look better on HiDPI screens. This has no effect on a real mobile device. It just improves the development experience.
* Themes: when disposing, unregisters bitmap fonts, clears texture onRestore function, and clears StandardIcons class.
* Themes: desktop themes now use HiDPI textures.

### 2.2.0-beta Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `FeathersEventType.ERROR` constant is deprecated. The `ImageLoader` component used this constant, and it now dispatches separate `Event.IO_ERROR` and `Event.SECURITY_ERROR` events. Error events should always be specific.

The `nameList` property on the `IFeathersControl` interface was originally deprecated in Feathers 2.0.0, and it has now been removed. It is replaced by the `styleNameList` property.

The `manageVisibility` property on layouts was originally deprecated in Feathers 2.0.0, and it has now been removed. This property no longer provided the performance improvements that it was originally intended for.

Properties such as `customThumbName` on the `Slider` component have have been renamed. In this case, `customThumbName` is deprecated and replaced by `customThumbStyleName`. Similarly, the static constant `Slider.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_THUMB` has been deprecated and renamed `Slider.DEFAULT_CHILD_STYLE_NAME_THUMB`. Similarly, the static constant `Button.ALTERNATE_NAME_BACK_BUTTON` has been deprecated and renamed `Button.ALTERNATE_STYLE_NAME_BACK_BUTTON`. On all components, APIs that refer to the *name* of sub-components have been deprecated and they have been replaced by a similar API that refers to the *style name* instead. For brevity, the list below shows the mapping between the old naming conventions and the new naming conventions instead of listing each renamed property individually.

* `custom*Name` => `custom*StyleName`
* `DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_*` => `DEFAULT_CHILD_STYLE_NAME_*`
* `ALTERNATE_NAME_*` => `ALTERNATE_STYLE_NAME_*`

The `List` and `GroupedList` components had some properties that didn't follow the original `custom*Name` naming convention. In both classes, the `itemRendererName` property has been deprecated and replaced by `customItemRendererStyleName`. In `GroupedList`, `firstItemRendererName`, `lastItemRendererName` and `singleItemRendererName` have been deprecated and replaced by `customFirstItemRendererStyleName`, `customLastItemRendererStyleName`, and `customSingleItemRendererStyleName` respectively. Similarly, `headerRendererName` and `footerRendererName` have been deprecated and replaced by `customHeaderRendererStyleName` and `customFooterRendererStyleName` respectively. With this change, these properties no longer diverge from the naming convention used for similar properties on other components.

All of the above renamed APIs were deprecated in Feathers 2.1.0, and they remain deprecated in Feathers 2.2.0.

### 2.2.0-beta API Changes

The `scrollToPageIndex()` function in the `Scroller` class, and its subclasses, no longer accepts `-1` as a valid way of specifying that the horizontal or vertical page index should not change. You must pass in the current value of the `horizontalPageIndex` or `verticalPageIndex` property instead. With the ability to have negative page indices, `-1` must now be available as a valid page index.

In the following code, the vertical page index is not meant to be changed:

```
list.scrollToPageIndex( 2, -1 );
```

The code would need to be modified, like this:

```
list.scrollToPageIndex( 2, list.verticalPageIndex );
```

## 2.1.1

* BitmapFontTextRenderer, ScrollContainer: added workarounds for compiler bugs in Adobe Flex SDK 4.6.
* ButtonGroup, TabBar: fixed issue where buttons or tabs would flicker and resize for a frame when the container resizes.
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout: fixed an issue that resulted in no scrolling when the scrollToDisplayIndex() function is called on a List.
* ScrollContainer: fixed issue where setting autoSizeMode to AUTO_SIZE_MODE_STAGE resulted in being unable to scroll.
* SpinnerList: fixed issue where setting the selected index programmatically didn't always update the scroll position.
* TextBlockTextRenderer, TextFieldTextRenderer: fixed issue where text would appear blurry because snapToPixels incorrectly snapped on the y-axis.

## 2.1.0

* New Component: AutoComplete, a TextInput that provides a pop-up list of suggestions.
* New Component: SpinnerList, a list that changes selection when scrolling to an item.
* New Component: StackScreenNavigator, a variation of ScreenNavigator with a history stack that you can push and pop.
* New Component: WebView, displays a native web browser using StageWebView, but may be positioned in local coordinates. Available in AIR only.
* New Layout: VerticalSpinnerLayout, the default layout for the new SpinnerList component.
* New Transitions: ColorFade, Cover, Cube, Fade, Flip, Reveal, Slide.
* New Example: TransitionsExplorer demonstrates each transition.
* Unit tests: created unit tests for a number of Feathers components.
* Help: help files are now distributed with Feathers for offline use.
* AnchorLayout: fixed issue where items positioned relative to horizontalCenterAnchorDisplayObject or verticalCenterAnchorDisplayObject were not positioned correctly whent he anchor was at a higher depth.
* Button: added scaleWhenDown and scaleWhenHovering properties to scale the button in these states.
* BaseDefaultItemRenderer: fixed issue where data that is == null would be ignored in some cases by changing to stricter === null check.
* BitmapFontTextRenderer: fixed issue where a runtime error could be thrown if a character in the bitmap font had a width or height of 0.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: fixed issue where clearing the text on focus would cause the selection range to be invalid.
* BitmapFontTextEditor, TextBlockTextEditor: listens for flash.events.Event.SELECT_ALL instead of Ctrl/Command+A with a keyboard event because it didn't work properly on Mac.
* BitmapFontTextRenderer: fixed issue where the last word of a line would sometimes appear on the next line.
* CalloutPopUpContentManager, DropDownPopUpContentManager, VerticalCenteredPopUpContentManager: detects if pop-up is removed from stage externally so that Event.CLOSE is properly dispatched.
* DropDownPopUpContentManager: fixed issue where the source would close the pop-up while validating, but the pop-up was being positioned, causing a runtime error, so now checks if open after source is validated.
* FeathersControl: added move() convenience function to set x and y properties, similar to how setSize() sets width and height.
* FeathersControl: the styleProvider property may be changed after initialization.
* FeathersControl: changes to styleNameList after initialization now causes the styleProvider to be re-applied.
* FeathersControl: may now flatten even when not initialized or on stage.
* FEATHERS_VERSION: new constant that can be used to see the version of Feathers being used.
* FocusManager: both containers and their children may receive focus separately (to allow the container to scroll with the keyboard), thanks to the new IFocusContainer interface.
* HierarchicalCollection: added removeAll() function, similar to ListCollection.
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout: when alignment is justified, the size of the item renderer is reset so that an accurate measurement can be taken instead of using the old justified size.
* HorizontalLayout: added requestColumnCount property for more control over width auto-measurement.
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout: fixed issue where the number of item renderers didn't remain constant when using hasVariableItemDimensions when all item renderers were the same size.

* List, GroupedList: updates scroll position, if needed, when using arrow keys to change selection.
* List, GroupedList: dispatches Event.TRIGGERED when an item renderer is triggered. The event data is the item from the data provider.
* List, GroupedList: added stricter === null check when checking if a typicalItem has been set because values like 0 could match == null.
* List, GroupedList: fixed issue where layout didn't update after an item renderer resized while the list wasn't validating.
* List, GroupedList: fixed issue where the typical item renderer resized, but the layout wasn't updated.
* List, GroupedList: fixed issue where changing the index of a typical item chosen from the data provider would not update the index of its item renderer.
* ListCollection: setting data property to null keeps null instead of removing all items from existing data.
* NumericStepper: added valueFormatFunction and valueParseFunction properties to support custom formatting.
* Panel: added new title and headerTitleField properties to use instead of going through headerProperties.
* Panel: fixed issue where outerPaddingBottom was ignored if the panel didn't have a footer.
* PanelScreen: added missing DEFAULT_CHILD_STYLE_NAME_FOOTER constant for use in themes.
* PickerList: dispatches Event.OPEN and Event.CLOSE when the pop-up list opens and closes.
* PickerList, TabBar: fixes issue where Event.CHANGE was incorrectly dispatched on disposal because dataProvider was set to null.
* Scale3Textures, Scale9Textures: fixed validation of region sizes when using a scaled texture that doesn't match Starling.contentScaleFactor.
* ScreenNavigator: fixes issue where new screen wasn't resized properly by validating self if validation queue is currently busy.
* ScreenNavigator: adds a delay of two frames before starting a transition animation because it significantly improves the performance of the transition.

* ScreenNavigator: added support for transitions that may cancel themselves.
* ScreenNavigator: added optional transition function argument to showScreen() and clearScreen().
* ScreenNavigator: fixes issue where active screen wasn't properly cleared if removed with removeScreen() or removeAllScreens().
* ScreenNavigator: dispatches FeathersEventType.TRANSITION_IN_START, FeathersEventType.TRANSITION_IN_COMPLETE, FeathersEventType.TRANSITION_OUT_START, and FeathersEventType.TRANSITION_OUT_COMPLETE on screens (not on self). Screens may listen for these events instead of the events dispatched by ScreenNavigator.
* ScreenNavigatorItem: added setFunctionForEvent() and setScreenIDForEvent().
* ScreenNavigatorItem: The properties getter will always be a valid object. It won't return null.

* Scroller: can receive focus to control scroll position with keyboard.
* Scroller: fixed issue where snapToPages was ignored when using mouse wheel or throwing.
* Scroller: fixed issue where animation for elastic snapping would restart on every touch when the distance was less than 1 pixel, causing it to appear that the item renderers could not be touched.
* ScrollContainer: added autoSizeMode property to specify that it should fill the stage.
* ScrollContainer: fixed issue where outer container didn't invalidate when adding or removing children, or when children are resized, causing validate() to have no effect.
* StageTextTextEditor, TextFieldTextEditor: fixes issue where focus remained when parent was set invisible.
* StyleNameFunctionTheme: the getStyleProviderForClass() function is now public.
* TabBar, ToggleGroup, List, GroupedList, PickerList: fixed issue where Event.CHANGE was not dispatched when removing an item and the selectedIndex remains the same, but the selectedItem is different.
* TabBar: default selectedIndex is -1 until the data provider is set.
* TabBar: Event.CHANGE is dispatched immediately when selectedIndex property changes instead of waiting for validation. Makes it more consistent with other components, like List.
* TextFieldTextEditor: fixed issue where HTML formatting is lost if edited when isHTML is true.
* TextFieldTextEditor: fixed issue where snapshot wasn't updated when size changed, but data or styles did not.
* TextFieldTextEditorViewPort: added padding properties.

* TextFieldTextRenderer, TextBlockTextRenderer: fixed issue where only the first texture (if multiple textures were required) was positioned properly when using native filters.
* TextFieldTextRenderer, TextBlockTextRenderer: fixed issue where texture snapshots could be clipped too small when using native filters.

### 2.1.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `nameList` property on the `IFeathersControl` interface has been deprecated, and it is replaced by the `styleNameList` property. The `name` property is no longer connected to style names, and situations where it failed to work with `getChildByName()` have been resolved. The `styleName` property has been added to replace the former usage of the `name` property as a concatenated version of `nameList` (now, `styleNameList`). The `nameList` property was deprecated in Feathers 2.0.0, and it remains deprecated in Feathers 2.1.0.

The `manageVisibility` property on layouts has been deprecated. In previous versions, this property could be used to improve performance of non-virtual layouts by hiding items that were outside the view port. However, other performance improvements have made it so that setting `manageVisibility` can now sometimes hurt performance instead of improving it. The `manageVisibility` property was deprecated in Feathers 2.0.0, and it remains deprecated in Feathers 2.1.0.

Similar to how the `nameList` property was renamed `styleNameList` in Feathers 2.0.0, properties such as `customThumbName` on the `Slider` component have have been renamed too. In this case, `customThumbName` is deprecated and replaced by `customThumbStyleName`. Similarly, the static constant `Slider.DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_THUMB` has been deprecated and renamed `Slider.DEFAULT_CHILD_STYLE_NAME_THUMB`. Similarly, the static constant `Button.ALTERNATE_NAME_BACK_BUTTON` has been deprecated and renamed `Button.ALTERNATE_STYLE_NAME_BACK_BUTTON`. On all components, APIs that refer to the *name* of sub-components have been deprecated and they have been replaced by a similar API that refers to the *style name* instead. For brevity, the list below shows the mapping between the old naming conventions and the new naming conventions instead of listing each renamed property individually.

* `custom*Name` => `custom*StyleName`
* `DEFAULT_CHILD_NAME_*` => `DEFAULT_CHILD_STYLE_NAME_*`
* `ALTERNATE_NAME_*` => `ALTERNATE_STYLE_NAME_*`

The `List` and `GroupedList` components had some properties that didn't follow the original `custom*Name` naming convention. In both classes, the `itemRendererName` property has been deprecated and replaced by `customItemRendererStyleName`. In `GroupedList`, `firstItemRendererName`, `lastItemRendererName` and `singleItemRendererName` have been deprecated and replaced by `customFirstItemRendererStyleName`, `customLastItemRendererStyleName`, and `customSingleItemRendererStyleName` respectively. Similarly, `headerRendererName` and `footerRendererName` have been deprecated and replaced by `customHeaderRendererStyleName` and `customFooterRendererStyleName` respectively. With this change, these properties no longer diverge from the naming convention used for similar properties on other components.

### 2.1.0 API Changes

#### ILayout

The `getNearestScrollPositionForIndex()` method has been added to the `ILayout` interface. Custom implementations of `ILayout` created before Feathers 2.1.0 will have compiler errors until the required changes are made.

This method is meant to calculate an updated scroll position for a specific index that requires the minimum amount of scrolling to fully display the specified index within the container's view port. It was added so that components like `List` could update the scroll position when changing the selected index with the keyboard when the component has focus.

To maintain the existing behavior (where the container doesn't scroll at all) to simply bypass the compiler error, the following implementation will return the existing scroll position:

	public function getNearestScrollPositionForIndex(index:int, scrollX:Number, scrollY:Number, items:Vector.<DisplayObject>, x:Number, y:Number, width:Number, height:Number, result:Point = null):Point
	{
		if(!result)
		{
			return new Point(scrollX, scrollY);
		}
		result.setTo(scrollX, scrollY);
		return result;
	}

#### Scroller now implements IFocusDisplayObject

With the addition of the new `IFocusContainer` interface, it is now possible for a container and its children to both appear in the tab focus chain when the `FocusManager` is enabled. Previously, subclasses of `Scroller`, like `List` or `ScrollContainer`, could not receive focus to allow the user to control the scroll position with the keyboard because the children wouldn't be able to receive focus too. Now, with the new interface and an updated focus manager, that restriction is lifted, and `Scroller` implements `IFocusDisplayObject` to support keyboard scrolling.

Subclasses of `Scroller` that need to support passing focus to children must now implement `IFocusContainer`. `List`, `ScrollContainer`, `GroupedList` have been updated, obviously, but custom subclasses of `Scroller` may need to be updated to support focus. `IFocusContainer` requires one property, `isChildFocusEnabled`. For convenience, you may copy following implementation of `isChildFocusEnabled` into a subclass of `Scroller`:

	protected var _isChildFocusEnabled:Boolean = true;

	public function get isChildFocusEnabled():Boolean
	{
		return this._isEnabled && this._isChildFocusEnabled;
	}

	public function set isChildFocusEnabled(value:Boolean):void
	{
		this._isChildFocusEnabled = value;
	}

## 2.0.1

* AddOnFunctionStyleProvider: fixed issue where function passed into constructor would be ignored.
* LayoutGroup: fixed issue where background skin would not validate after setting its dimensions.
* Scale3Image, Scale9Image, TiledImage: updated to listen for Event.FLATTEN to validate instead of overriding flatten() to remain compatible with the new flatten() function signature in Starling 1.6.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue where StageText.stage was null, and calling drawViewPortToBitmapData() resulted in a runtime error.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue where setFocus() didn't work if StageText.stage was null.
* TextInput: fixed issue where runtime error would be thrown after changing prompt from null to a valid string after input had validated.
* Themes: fixed issue in desktop themes where assets displayed at 4x instead of 2x on HiDPI Macs.
* Themes: fixed issue in desktop themes where PanelScreen and ScrollScreen would incorrectly use mobile scroll bars and behaviors.
* Themes: fixed issue where a subclass would add a style function for the ToggleSwitch class, and that would cause some ToggleSwitch instances to be missing skins.
* Themes: fixed issue where wrong arguments were passed to Texture.fromBitmap().
* Added workarounds for stack overflow runtime errors when compiling with legacy Flex 4.6 compiler.

## 2.0.0

* New style provider architecture for skinning and themes.
* Components may always be validated, even if they are not on the display list yet.
* New Text Editor: TextBlockTextEditor is a desktop-only text editor built on FTE, similar to TextBlockTextRenderer.
* New Text Editor: BitmapFontTextEditor is a desktop-only text editor built on bitmap fonts, similar to BitmapFontTextRenderer.
* All Components: subComponentProperties pattern is now stricter. If properties that don't exist are set, a runtime error will be thrown.
* BitmapFontTextRenderer: properly redraws when isEnabled is changed.
* BitmapFontTextRenderer: if textFormat is null, generates a default value so that something will be displayed (using Starling's embedded BitmapFont.MINI).
* Button: added minGap property that is used when gap is set to Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY.
* Button: pulled out toggle functionality into a subclass: ToggleButton.
* Button: removed now-useless autoFlatten property.
* Button: added new hasLabelTextRenderer that may be set to false to avoid creating the text renderer (for things like scroll bar or slider button sub-components).
* Button: fixed issue where button didn't return to up state when focus is changed with keyboard while in another state.
* Callout: added stagePadding property to set stagePaddingTop, stagePaddingRight, stagePaddingBottom, and stagePaddingLeft properties all at once.
* Callout: fixed issue where touch listener was removed when callout was removed, but it wasn't re-added when the same callout instance was shown again.
* DefaultGroupedListHeaderOrFooterRenderer: fixed issue where content wasn't disabled when isEnabled changed.
* Drawers: added optional overlaySkin property to fade in a display object over the content when a drawer is opened.
* Drawers: checks if event types are null before adding listeners.
* Drawers: open and close events now pass the display object in the event data.
* Drawers: fix for issue where wrong toggle duration may used sometimes.
* DropDownPopUpContentManager: added new gap property.
* FeathersControl: enforced as an abstract class. If you need a generic Feathers component wrapper for layoutData and things, use LayoutGroup.
* FeathersControl: added styleName and styleNameList property to replace nameList. The name property is no longer used for styling, and it will work for getChildByName() in the rare situations where it was broken. The nameList property is deprecated.
* FeathersControl: fixed issue where changing minTouchWidth or minTouchHeight did not update the hit area if the width or height wasn't changed at the same time.
* FeathersControl: fixed issue where component would validate when disposed.
* FeathersControl: fixed issue in setSize() where scaled dimensions weren't updated.
* FocusManager: support for custom IFocusManager instances and support for multiple Starling stages.

* Header: added useExtraPaddingForOSStatusBar property to support iOS 7 status bar behavior.
* Header: getters for leftItems, rightItems, and centerItems no longer duplicate the array.
* Header: now disposed leftItems, rightItems, and centerItems by default. Can be controlled with new disposeItems property.
* Header: fixed issue where title text renderer's isEnabled property wasn't properly updated.
* Header: fixed issue where the touchable property was incorrectly set to false on some children.

* ImageLoader: fixed issue where isLoaded getter didn't always return true if the source is a texture.
* ImageLoader: fixed issue where loaded textures could be uploaded to wrong Starling instance if multiple Starling instances were active.
* Item Renderers: added skinField, skinFunction, and itemHasSkin for background skins from the data provider.

* Scroller: skips some unnecessary code when dimensions are explicit to improve performance.
* Scroller: added new measureViewPort property that can be set to false to exclude the view port from auto-measurement and only use the background skin.

* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue on iOS where characters were masked immediately instead of showing in the clear for a moment.
* StageTextTextEditor: fixed issue where the clipboard menu appeared unexpectedly when multiline is true.
* StageTextTextEditor: draws StageText to BitmapData with double dimensions on Mac HiDPI, thanks to Adobe's bug fix.
* TabBarSlideTransitionManager: fixes bug where switching between tabs quickly would break the transition.
* Text: will use non-power-of-two textures for snapshots, if the Stage 3D profile supports it.

### 2.0.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `nameList` property has been deprecated, and it is replaced by the `styleNameList` property. The `name` property is no longer connected to style names, and situations where it failed to work with `getChildByName()` have been resolved. The `styleName` property has been added to replace the former usage of the `name` property as a concatenated version of `nameList` (now, `styleNameList`).

The `manageVisibility` property on layouts has been deprecated. In previous versions, this property could be used to improve performance of non-virtual layouts by hiding items that were outside the view port. However, other performance improvements have made it so that setting `manageVisibility` can now sometimes hurt performance instead of improving it.

### 2.0.0 Default Behavior and API Changes

This is a major update to Feathers, so it includes more breaking changes than usual. Be sure to read this section thoroughly to see if any of these changes will affect your apps.

`TextFieldTextRenderer` and `TextFieldTextEditor` now have a `useGutter` property that controls whether the 2-pixel gutter around the edges of the `flash.text.TextField` will be used in measurement and layout. In previous versions of Feathers, the gutter was always enabled. The gutter is now disabled by default to allow text controls based on `TextField` to more easily align with other text controls.

The `ITextRenderer` and `ITextEditor` interfaces now extend the `ITextBaselineControl` interface. In the case of `ITextEditor`, a new `baseline` getter is required.

The `ITextRenderer` interface now requires a `wordWrap` property.

The `IFocusDisplayObject` interface now requires a `focusOwner` property.

Properties including `dpiScale`, `pixelScale`, `originalWidth`, `originalHeight`, and `originalDPI` have been removed from `Screen`, `ScrollScreen` and `PanelScreen`. The calculations previously offered by these properties should be handled in skinning code, such as the theme.

The `Button` class no longer supports selection. This functionality has been moved into a subclass, `ToggleButton`.

The `autoFlatten` property has been removed from the `Button` class.

Setting the properties of a sub-component, such as using `thumbProperties` on a `Slider` to set properties on the slider's thumb sub-component, is now stricter. Previously, when a property did not exist, it was silently ignored. Now, an error will be thrown.

If no text format is defined, `BitmapFontTextRenderer` defaults to using `BitmapFont.MINI` so that the text will always be rendered. Previously, it would render nothing.

If no element format is defined, `TextBlockTextRenderer` defaults to using a new `ElementFormat` with default arguments so that the text will always be rendered. Previously, an error was thrown.

A `trackInteractionMode` property has been added to `Slider`. In previous versions, `Slider` behaved as if `trackInteractionMode` were set to `Slider.TRACK_INTERACTION_MODE_BY_PAGE`. Now, the default value is `Slider.TRACK_INTERACTION_MODE_TO_VALUE`.

A `verticalAlign` property has been added to `TextInput`. In previous versions, `TextInput` behaved as if `verticalAlign` were set to `TextInput.VERTICAL_ALIGN_JUSTIFY`. Now, the default value is `TextInput.VERTICAL_ALIGN_MIDDLE`.

The `FeathersControl` class is now considered abstract. It will throw a runtime error if instantiated directly instead of being subclassed. If you need a generic Feathers component as a wrapper for another display object, use `LayoutGroup` instead.

The `leftItems`, `rightItems`, and `centerItems` getters on the `Header` class no longer make a copy of their storage variables. Take care when modifying these values directly.

Focus management now supports multiple Starling stages (for AIR desktop apps). The static `isEnabled` property has been removed. Instead, you should use the static `setEnabledForStage()` function:

```as3
FocusManager.setEnabledForStage( Starling.current.stage, true );
```

All layouts now account for the `pivotX` and `pivotY` properties when positioning display objects. In previous versions, these properties were ignored.

When the `direction` property of a `ProgressBar` is equal to `ProgressBar.DIRECTION_VERTICAL`, the fill now starts at the bottom and fills up.

The increment button and decrement button sub-components of a `ScrollBar` are now hidden when the scroll bar's maximum scroll position is equal to its minimum scroll position, just like how the thumb is hidden. The track will be resized to fill the extra space where the buttons were previously rendered.

When replacing the `dataProvider` of a `List` or `GroupedList` (or replacing the `data` property of a `ListCollection` or `HierarchicalCollection`), it is no longer necessary to call `updateItemAt()` on the new collection if it contains some of the same items as the previous collection. This behavior will happen automatically.

### 1.3.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `scrollerProperties` property on scrolling components, including List, GroupedList, ScrollText and ScrollContainer was originally deprecated in Feathers 1.1.0, and it has now been removed. Because these components now extend `Scroller` instead of adding a `Scroller` as a child, all of the properties that could be set through `scrollerProperties` can now be set directly on the components.

### 1.3.0 API Changes

Some changes have been made to Feathers that have the potential to break code in existing projects. Changes of this type may be considered [exceptions to the Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy#exceptions), and careful consideration is made to limit the impact of these changes on existing projects. Most developers using Feathers will not be affected by these changes, except perhaps, to observe improved stability and consistency.

#### ILayout

One change has been made to the `ILayout` interface. Custom implementations of `ILayout` created before Feathers 1.3.0 will have compiler errors until the required changes are made.

The property `requiresLayoutOnScroll` has been added to `ILayout` to provide improved performance for static layouts that don't change when a container scrolls.

 This property can easily simulate the old behavior from Feathers 1.2.0, if required. The following implementation of `requiresLayoutOnScroll` can easily be copied into a custom implementations of `ILayout` to quickly migrate existing Feathers 1.2.0 implementations to behave exactly the same in Feathers 1.3.0:

	public function get requiresLayoutOnScroll():Boolean
	{
		return true;
	}

### 1.2.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `scrollerProperties` property on scrolling components, including List, GroupedList, ScrollText and ScrollContainer is deprecated. Because these components now extend `Scroller` instead of adding a `Scroller` as a child, all of the properties that could be set through `scrollerProperties` can now be set directly on the components. The `scrollerProperties` property was deprecated in Feathers 1.1.0, and it remains deprecated in Feathers 1.2.0. 

### 1.2.0 API Changes

Some changes have been made to Feathers that have the potential to break code in existing projects. Changes of this type are considered [exceptions to the Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy#exceptions), and careful consideration is made to limit the impact of these changes on existing projects. Most developers using Feathers will not be affected by these changes, except perhaps, to observe improved stability and consistency.

#### PopUpManager

Two changes have been made to the `PopUpManager`.

The function `isTopLevelPopUp()` has been modified to indicate if a pop-up is above the top-most modal overlay. Previously, this function indicated if a pop-up is the single top-most pop-up.

When a pop-up is centered when calling `PopUpManager.addPopUp()`, the `PopUpManager` will automatically realign the pop-up if the stage or the pop-up is resized. If you prefer that the pop-up isn't realigned, change the argument to `false` and call `PopUpManager.centerPopUp()` instead. It will align the pop-up only once. If you previously manually repositioned the pop-up to keep it centered when it or the stage resized, you may remove that code. However, if the code remains, it should not cause conflicts with the new behavior.

#### IVirtualLayout

Three changes have been made to the `IVirtualLayout` interface. Custom implementations of `IVirtualLayout` created before Feathers 1.2.0 will have compiler errors until the required changes are made. It is expected that a small number of Feathers developers have created custom implementations of `IVirtualLayout`, so this change will have no impact on the majority of projects that are upgraded from older versions of Feathers.

The `typicalItemWidth` and `typicalItemHeight` properties may be removed completely from custom `IVirtualLayout` implementations. In their place, the `typicalItem` property must be added. Components like `List` previously passed pre-calculated width and height values for a typical item display object. However, a layout may need to manipulate the typical item before calculating its dimensions. By giving more control to the layouts, their estimation of virtualized items will be more accurate.

The new `typicalItem` property might be declared as follows:

	/**
	 * @private
	 */
	protected var _typicalItem:DisplayObject;

	/**
	 * @inheritDoc
	 */
	public function get typicalItem():DisplayObject
	{
		return this._typicalItem;
	}

	/**
	 * @private
	 */
	public function set typicalItem(value:DisplayObject):void
	{
		if(this._typicalItem == value)
		{
			return;
		}
		this._typicalItem = value;
		this.dispatchEventWith(Event.CHANGE);
	}

Usage of the new `typicalItem` property may depend on factors that are specific to each implementation. In general, an implementation will measure the typical item at the beginning of most of its public functions, including `layout()`, `getScrollPositionForIndex()`, `getVisibleIndicesAtScrollPosition()`, and `measureViewPort()`. If the typical item is a Feathers control, it should be validated. The following snippet shows the most basic case for how to request the typical item's dimensions:

	var measuredTypicalItemWidth:Number = 0;
	var measuredTypicalItemHeight:Number = 0;
	if( this._useVirtualLayout && this._typicalItem )
	{
		if( this._typicalItem is IFeathersControl )
		{
			//validate the typical item so that it reports the correct width and height
			this._typicalItem.validate();
		}

		measuredTypicalItemWidth = this._typicalItem.width;
		measuredTypicalItemHeight = this._typicalItem.height;
	}

If the typical item is a Feathers control, validate() should be called before requesting its dimensions. Optionally, the dimensions of a Feathers control may be reset to `NaN` in order to ask the control for its ideal dimensions. This will match the behavior introduced Feathers 1.1.x. However, in Feathers 1.2.0, the built-in layouts have chosen to reset the typical item's dimensions only when a flag is enabled. For many layouts, resetting the dimensions of the typical item is rarely required, and it may be undesireable. This change reverts the behavior to match Feathers 1.0.x, while still allowing advanced developers to re-enable the behavior introduced in Feathers 1.1.x.

For more advanced code, take a look at one of the built-in layout classes, such as `VerticalLayout`.

Note: The built-in layout classes repurpose the `typicalItemWidth` and `typicalItemHeight` properties that were removed from `IVirtualLayout` to work with a new `resetTypicalItemDimensionsOnMeasure` property. By default, setting these properties outside of a component like `List` will have no effect, which exactly matches the behavior from all older versions of Feathers. Custom layouts may elect to provide this same capability, but it is not required by the `IVirtualLayout` interface.

#### GroupedList

The `typicalHeader` and `typicalFooter` properties have been removed from `GroupedList` to support the better handling of typical items in virtual layouts, as discussed above. From now on, the `typicalItem` on a `GroupedList` is the only way to provide hints to the layout used by a `GroupedList`.

## 1.1.1

This release includes minor updates to support Starling Framework 1.4 and a number of minor bug fixes.

* Switches to Starling's implementation of the clipRect property.
* Uses Texture onRestore for internally managed textures, like in text controls.
* StageTextTextEditor: fix for displayAsPassword clearing the text.
* Panel: won't scroll if mouse wheel or touch occurs in header or footer.
* Panel: header and footer can be touched when content is scrolling.

* Item Renderers: smarter handling of accessory resizing.
* Item Renderers: better measurement to account for NaN.
* Item Renderers: properly checks for _data, in addition to _owner, in commitData().
* Label: sets proper text renderer dimensions if height is explicitly set.
* Radio: better handling of setting toggleGroup to avoid accidentally adding to defaultRadioGroup.
* Scroller: properly updates isEnabled on scroll bars when they are first created.
* Scroller: child touches are blocked until throw animation finishes to match native behavior.
* Scroll bars: better isEnabled handling.

* NumericStepper: if TextInput sub-component is editable, it will be selected on focus in.
* TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsLayout: fixed manageVisibility implementation.
* TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsLayout: fixed bad positioning when useSquareTiles is true.

## 1.1.0

* New Beta Component: NumericStepper. Add and subtract from a numeric value with buttons. Optional text editing.
* New Beta Component: TextArea. A multiline text input. Recommended for desktop only. Not recommended for mobile.
* New Beta Component: Panel. A new container subclassing ScrollContainer that adds a header and an optional footer.
* New Beta Component: PanelScreen. An IScreen implementation (similar to Screen) based on Panel.
* New Beta Layout: AnchorLayout. Added to support fluid layouts and relative positioning. Can position relative to parent container and also to other children of the parent container.
* Added FocusManager for keyboard navigation and interaction. Not intended for mobile. Use a desktop theme or set `FocusManager.isEnabled = true`. TextInput *cannot* use StageTextTextEditor when focus management is enabled. TextFieldTextEditor is recommended.
* All Components: sub-components are created from factories and can receive custom names for theming.
* Added ILayoutObject interface to support extra data for layouts to use, like includeInLayout property.
* List: support for optional multiple selection.
* TextInput: supports prompt/hint
* TextInput/StageTextTextEditor: supports multiline on mobile.
* PickerList: supports prompt when no item is selected.
* Slider: measurement now includes thumb dimensions and a new property called trackScaleMode has been added.
* Callout: disposal is more consistent. Set combination of disposeOnSelfClose and disposeContent.
* Callout: doesn't close when origin is touched. origin should now separately determine correct behavior.
* Callout: added origin and supportedDirections properties to make Callout capable of switching origins after creation.
* Item Renderers: properly handle accessory resizing if accessory is a FeathersControl.
* Item Renderers: fixes for a number of layout order, gap, and alignment combinations.
* PickerList: doesn't close when touching scroll bar. only item renderer touch will trigger a close.

* PopUpManager: modal pop-ups receive a different focus manager.
* ScreenNavigator: added hasScreen(), getScreen(), and getScreenIDs().
* ScreenNavigator: added autoSizeMode property to select between sizing to fit stage or to fit content.
* ScreenNavigator: fix for broken transition if showScreen() is calleed before transition begins but after new screen is added to stage.
* Transitions: fix for quickStack constructor argument.
* ScrollContainer, List, GroupedList: better auto-sizing with a background skin.
* ScrollContainer: new alternate name for toolbar style.
* TextInput: exposed isEditable, maxChars, restrict, and displayAsPassword properties.
* BitmapFontTextRenderer, Scale3Image, Scale9Image: option to turn off the use of a separate QuadBatch.
* TextFieldTextEditor: better selection on mobile.
* TextFieldTextEditor: properly dispatches FeathersEventType.ENTER.
* Text Renderers and Editors: better snapshot disposal.
* TextFieldTextRenderer: better measurement to workaround runtime dimensions being wrong.
* TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsLayout: supports separate horizontal and vertical gaps.
* TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsLayout: more stable virtualized item renderer count to improve performance.
* TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsLayout: fixes for certain issues with paging.
* ButtonGroup: supports isEnabled as a property in the data provider.

* Scroller: exposes horizontal and vertical page count properties.
* Scroller: added FeathersEventType.SCROLL_START event.
* Scroller: scroll bars are hidden when stopScrolling() is called.
* Scroller: fix for velocity calculation.
* Button: better detection of click to avoid other display objects moving on top of button before TouchPhase.ENDED.
* Button: new styles for themes, including back, forward, call-to-action, quiet, and danger.
* List: if items are added or removed, selected indices are adjusted.
* List, GroupedList, ScrollContainer, and ScrollText all extend Scroller, instead of using it as a sub-component. The scrollerProperties property on each of these is now deprecated because all public properties of Scroller are now direct public properties of these components. Theme initializers that target Scroller will break because Scroller is no longer a sub-component, but a super class of classes like List. Move this stuff into initializers for List, GroupedList, ScrollContainer, and ScrollText.
* FeathersControl: setSizeInternal() is now stricter. It can never receive a NaN value for width or height. This is a common source of bugs, and throwing an error here will help make it easier to find those bugs.
* IVariableVirtualLayout: added function addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex() for more specific control over the cache of item dimensions.
* IVariableVirtualLayout: added function removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex() for more specific control over the cache of item dimensions.
* ScrollText: now properly handles visible and alpha properties.
* ListCollection: added removeAll(), addAll(), addAllAt() and contains().
* Scroller: scrolling animates for mouse wheel.
* List, VerticalLayout, HorizontalLayout: optimized case where useVirtualLayout is true and hasVariableItemDimensions is false.
* HorizontalLayout, VerticalLayout, TiledRowsLayout, TiledColumnsLayout: added manageVisibility property to set items to false when not in view. Set to true to improve performance.
* Item Renderers: added stopScrollingOnAccessoryTouch property to make accessory touch behavior configurable.
* Screen: default value of originalDPI is DeviceCapabilities.dpi. It used to be 168. Can still be changed.
* MetalWorksMobileTheme and MinimalMobileTheme: major overhaul with improved skins and new alternate skins.
* AeonDesktopTheme: added some missing skins, like TabBar.
* AeonDesktopTheme: uses FocusManager.
* AzureMobileTheme: removed this example theme. Please feel free to continue using the old version, if desired.
* ComponentsExplorer: better button screen to show off various styles of buttons.
* Todos: new example.
* All Examples: Use PanelScreen instead of Screen and Header where appropriate.
* All Examples: Use AnchorLayout where appropriate.
* All Examples: Uses NumericStepper instead of Slider where appropriate.
* Added 96x96 icons to examples for Android xhdpi. Requires AIR 3.7.
* Extended API documentation with inline examples and improved descriptions.
* Added many new articles to the Feathers Manual.
* Now built with ASC 2.0.

### 1.1.0 Deprecated APIs

All deprecated APIs are subject to the [Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy). Please migrate to the new APIs as soon as possible because the deprecated APIs **will** be removed in a future version of Feathers.

The `scrollerProperties` property on scrolling components, including List, GroupedList, ScrollText and ScrollContainer is deprecated. Because these components now extend `Scroller` instead of adding a `Scroller` as a child, all of the properties that could be set through `scrollerProperties` can now be set directly on the components.

### 1.1.0 API Changes

Some changes have been made to Feathers that have the potential to break code in existing projects. Changes of this type are considered [exceptions to the Feathers deprecation policy](http://wiki.starling-framework.org/feathers/deprecation-policy#exceptions), and careful consideration is made to limit the impact of these changes on existing projects. Most developers using Feathers will not be affected by these changes, except perhaps, to observe improved stability and consistency.

#### IVariableVirtualLayout

Two changes have been made to the `IVariableVirtualLayout` interface. Custom implementations of `IVariableVirtualLayout` created before Feathers 1.1.0 will have compiler errors until the required changes are made. It is expected that a very small number of Feathers developers have created custom implementations of `IVariableVirtualLayout`, so this change will have no impact on the vast majority of projects that are upgraded from older versions of Feathers.

The functions `addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` and `removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` have been added to `IVariableVirtualLayout` to provide lower-level control over the cache of item dimensions. Instead of clearing the entire cache, a component may insert or remove a specific index from the cache. For instance, the `List` component uses these functions when its data provider is manipulated. These functions allow the layout to provide more accuracy to its virtualization and to improve performance.

 These two functions can easily simulate the old behavior from Feathers 1.0.x, if required. The following implementations of `addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` and `removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex()` can easily be copied into a custom implementations of `IVariableVirtualLayout` to quickly migrate existing Feathers 1.0.x implementations to behave exactly the same in Feathers 1.1.0:

	public function addToVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex(index:int, item:DisplayObject = null):void
	{
		this.resetVariableVirtualCache();
	}

	public function removeFromVariableVirtualCacheAtIndex(index:int, item:DisplayObject = null):void
	{
		this.resetVariableVirtualCache();
	}

## 1.0.1

This release includes a number of bug fixes.

* Scroller: FeathersEventType.SCROLL_COMPLETE always dispatched after last Event.SCROLL.
* ScrollBar, SimpleScrollBar: thumb position properly accounts for padding.
* Scroller: mouse wheel detection properly accounts for contentScaleFactor.
* ScreenNavigator: calling clearScreen() during a transition no longer causes a stack overflow.
* ScrollBar, SimpleScrollBar: can drag to minimum and maximum if they aren't a multiple of the step.
* Header: Fix for runtime error when rightItems aren't IFeathersDisplayObjects
* TextInput: better selection/cursor recovery when changing text programmatically.
* TextInput: Moved fontSize contentScaleFactor multiplication into StageTextTextEditor.
* FeathersControl: requires isInitialized to be true before it can validate.
* FeathersControl: clipRect properly accounts for scale.
* GroupedList: added missing documentation for setSelectedLocation().
* ImageLoader: does a better job keeping aspect ratio when only one dimension is explicit.
* ImageLoader: properly scales content when dimensions are explicit.
* ImageLoader: no runtime errors if content loads after dispose.
* ScrollContainer, List, GroupedList, ScrollText: fix for detecting changes in scrollToPageIndex().

## 1.0.0

No major API changes since 1.0.0 BETA. Mostly bug fixes and minor improvements.

* Fix for memory leaks in List, GroupedList, and ImageLoader
* PageIndicator properly handles ImageLoader or other IFeathersControl as symbol
* IGroupedListHeaderOrFooterRenderer extends IFeathersControl
* Header: fix for "middle" vertical alignment
* Updated for Starling Framework 1.3

## 1.0.0 BETA

Initial release. The following major changes happened in the last month or two leading to the beta.

* GTween library removed as a dependency. All animations switched to the Starling `Tween` class.
* as3-signals library removed as a dependency. Switched to Starling events.
* `TextInput`: supports swappable text editors, similar to the text renderers used for uneditable text. The default `StageTextTextEditor` uses `StageText` to allow text input, which is ideal for mobile. The `TextFieldTextEditor` uses a `TextField` of `TextFieldType.INPUT` instead, and it may be a better choice for desktop. A static function, `defaultTextEditorFactory`, has been added to `FeathersControl`.
* `TextInput`: now has events for focus in and out.
* Item renderers: Switched to `ImageLoader` for icon and accessory textures, which has a `source` property that supports `Texture` instances or `String` URLs to load textures from the web. Properties like `iconTextureField` and `accessoryTextureFunction` now have new names like `iconSourceField` and `accessorySourceFunction` because values other than textures are now allowed. Similarly, `iconImageFactory` and `accessoryImageFactory` have been renamed to `iconLoaderFactory` and `accessoryLoaderFactory`.
* Item renderers: accessory may be positioned. See `layoutOrder` and `accessoryPosition` properties.
* Added `dispose()` method to `AddedWatcher` so that theme resources like textures be disposed.
* Added `ScrollText` component to display text in an overlay on the native display list. Useful for long passages of text that may be too large to convert to a texture.
* `ScreenNavigator`: added events for transition start and complete.
* `ToggleSwitch`: `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_STRETCH` is now `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_ON_OFF`.
* `Slider`: `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_STRETCH` is now `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_MIN_MAX`.
* `ScrollBar`: `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_STRETCH` is now `TRACK_LAYOUT_MODE_MIN_MAX`.
